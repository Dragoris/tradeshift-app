## Tradeshift Triangle App

This is a simple app that takes in three length values from a form and will return the type of triangle thoes lengths will make. The form will submit after the following conditions are met: All input values must be positive integers and the sum of the lengths of any 2 sides of a triangle must be greater than the third side.

This project uses create-react-app for its out the box environment. All styling is done through the Tradeshift UI without additional libraries. Testing is handled by Jest and react testing library.

There are three components that comprise the app. The TriangleApp component is a class component that stores the state of the app and passes relevant props to its two functional child components, TriangleForm, which take in values, and Output,  which display results.
